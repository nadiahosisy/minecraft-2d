# 2D Minecraft ⛏️

Hey there👋, fellow adventurers of the digital realm! With a gleam of excitement and a heart full of curiosity, I'm setting forth on an exhilarating coding journey. While I may not have all the badges of a full-stack developer just yet, my hunger for knowledge and my passion for crafting solutions are boundless.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Minecraft 2D project! This is a simplified 2D version of the popular Minecraft game, designed to offer a unique gaming experience.

Hi 👋,I'm Nadia Hosisy from Israel, and I'm on a quest to become a full-stack web developer. My fascination with programming was ignited during the countless hours I spent navigating the blocky landscapes of Minecraft. Those moments of conquering challenges, one line of code at a time, left me hungry for more. Armed with CSS, HTML, and vanilla JavaScript, I embarked on a quest to create, innovate, and learn.
